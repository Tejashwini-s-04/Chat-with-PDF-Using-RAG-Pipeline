# Chat-with-PDF-Using-RAG-Pipeline
# Overview
This project, "Chat with PDF Using RAG Pipeline", is designed to simplify interaction with large PDF documents. Instead of manually searching through lengthy files, users can now upload a PDF, ask questions in natural language, and get accurate, context-based answers. The system combines retrieval and generation techniques for a seamless and intelligent document-querying experience.

# Features
Upload and Process PDFs: Extracts and preprocesses text from uploaded PDFs.
Conversational Interface: Users can ask natural language questions about the document's content.
Accurate Responses: Leverages the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for precise answers.
Efficient Retrieval: Retrieves relevant chunks of text using similarity-based methods.
Interactive: Provides clear and user-friendly answers, just like chatting with an assistant.

# Technologies Used
Python: Backend programming language.
PyPDF2: For extracting text from PDF files.
NLTK: Used for tokenization and text preprocessing.
Transformers: To implement language models for answer generation.
RAG Pipeline: Combines retrieval and generation for better performance.

# How It Works
Text Extraction: Extracts raw text from uploaded PDFs.
Text Chunking: Breaks the content into manageable pieces for efficient processing.
Embeddings: Converts text chunks into numerical representations for similarity matching.
Question Answering: Retrieves relevant chunks based on user queries and generates an answer.
